What is kafeville ? Kafeville was born in March 2016. Since then we've brought new methods of making coffee to Hanoi, the capital city that is well known for its conservative characteristics, especially when it comes to the coffee drinks. Located on the edge of the old quarter, we had gradually changed the way Hanoians used to have their coffee everyday.
Kafeville is a cozy place with friendly and helpful staff. Here you can enjoy the smell of roasting coffee beans, have some chit chat with a group of friends or family members, and of course, the best cup of Joe in town. This is a safe haven, a hideaway place, a home away from home to all coffee lovers! As one of the very first shops in Hanoi that brought the so called specialty coffee to this city, Kafeville has become more than a name or a place.
